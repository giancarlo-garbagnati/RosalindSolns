Problem
A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (k≤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

# First approach:
# The longest commong substring of a collection of DNA strings can't be longer than the shortest
#  DNA sequence <--- we'll start with that one. Going from len(shortestDNA) we'll look at each 
#  substring from the smallest DNA of that length and compare it to all other DNA strings until
#  we don't find a match. When that happens, we look at all substrings of -1 the previous len,
#  and compare to all others... repeat this until we are able to find one that matches all DNA
