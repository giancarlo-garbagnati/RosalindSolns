Modeling Random Genomes
Problem

An array is a structure containing an ordered collection of objects (numbers, strings, other arrays, etc.). We let A[k] denote the k-th value in array A. You may like to think of an array as simply a matrix having only one row.

A random string is constructed so that the probability of choosing each subsequent symbol is based on a fixed underlying symbol frequency.

GC-content offers us natural symbol frequencies for constructing random DNA strings. If the GC-content is x, then we set the symbol frequencies of C and G equal to x2 and the symbol frequencies of A and T equal to 1−x2. For example, if the GC-content is 40%, then as we construct the string, the next symbol is 'G'/'C' with probability 0.2, and the next symbol is 'A'/'T' with probability 0.3.

In practice, many probabilities wind up being very small. In order to work with small probabilities, we may plug them into a function that "blows them up" for the sake of comparison. Specifically, the common logarithm of x (defined for x>0 and denoted log10(x)) is the exponent to which we must raise 10 to obtain x.

See Figure 1 for a graph of the common logarithm function y=log10(x). In this graph, we can see that the logarithm of x-values between 0 and 1 always winds up mapping to y-values between −∞ and 0: x-values near 0 have logarithms close to −∞, and x-values close to 1 have logarithms close to 0. Thus, we will select the common logarithm as our function to "blow up" small probability values for comparison.

Figure 1. The graph of the common logarithm function of x. For a given x-value, the corresponding y-value is the exponent to which we must raise 10 to obtain x. Note that x-values between 0 and 1 get mapped to y-values between -infinity and 0.

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp and an array A containing at most 20 numbers between 0 and 1.

Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that a random string constructed with the GC-content found in A[k] will match s exactly.
